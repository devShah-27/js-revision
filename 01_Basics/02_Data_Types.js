"use strict"; // treats all your JS code based on newer JS standards and features

// There is no real reason to write this in modern JS files as most of the code is treated as strict by default.
// However, it is a good practice to write this statement down for clarity.

// alert(3 + 3); // does not work in node environment

let varName = "Dev";

console.log(typeof varName);
console.log(typeof null); // returns "object" as null is an object in JS.
console.log(typeof undefined); // returns "undefined" as it is a special type in JS.
